Iris Privacy Policy

We, the developers of Iris, do not collect any user data generated by users in the application.

By default, the application connects to entry nodes in a decentralized network. These nodes partake in relaying (and optionally storage) of encrypted messages and (currently) public user profiles. Users can change the list of nodes they connect to.

Messages are end-to-end encrypted, meaning they can be only read by their author and recipient. However, message timestamps are currently not encrypted, so that other nodes can return them in a sequential order. This makes it possible to guess who are communicating with each other.

User names, avatars and other possible profile details are currently not encrypted (this may change).
